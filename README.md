# Kalman-Filter
Here you can look into the application of kalman filter and extended kalman filter to estimate state and modal parameters of a linear dynamical system.<br/>
*I Hope you find this code helpful.*

[Very soon, theory of kalman filter and its extensions will be explained in each of its Readme files]
